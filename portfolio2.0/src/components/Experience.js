            <p>I completed the Software Engineering Immersive course through General Assembly. This course was intense and covered a vast array of technologies, tools and languages used today in both front-end and back-end developement. Through this course, I also gained experience with Git, working on group projects and managing my time while working remotely.

On top of my time with GA, I have used other resources to learn new skills including SoloLearn, CS50 and codewars. There is so much out there to learn and explore and I'm excited to keep driving my developement forward.</p>
